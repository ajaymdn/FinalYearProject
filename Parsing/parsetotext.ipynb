S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales.', 'In addition, the Company’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U. S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.', 'Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations can materially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services.', 'In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors.', 'Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 6In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.', 'Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company’s products; and insolvency.', 'A downturn in the economic environment can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments.', 'These and other economic factors can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.', 'The Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.', 'Political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.', 'The Company has a large, global business, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade.', 'Trade and other international disputes can result in tariffs, sanctions, and other measures that restrict international trade and can adversely affect the Company’s business.', 'For example, tensions between the U. S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U. S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions.', 'Tariffs increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them.', 'These increased costs adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products.', 'Tariffs can also make the Company’s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand.', 'Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company’s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to offer its products and services as designed.', 'These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms.', 'Changing the Company’s operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to management.', 'Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures.', 'Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s business.', 'Many of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters.', 'In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s control.', 'Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects.', 'Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings.', 'Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales.', 'Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.', 'The Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers.', 'While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company’s business and harm to the Company’s reputation.', 'Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and delays in production ramps of new products.', 'While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.', 'Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 7Global markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.', 'The Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.', 'The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace.', 'The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services.', 'As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D.', 'There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.', 'The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights.', 'In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its\\xa0intellectual property.', 'Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates.', 'If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected.', 'The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets.', 'The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships.', 'In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices.', 'Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins.', 'Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss.', 'Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.', 'Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.', 'The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.', 'The Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases.', 'The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free.', 'The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.', 'The Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages.', 'There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.', 'Business Risks To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.', 'Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services.', 'The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company’s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies.', 'There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.', 'Apple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 8The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U. S. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia.', 'A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations.', 'The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management.', 'While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution.', 'Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions.', 'Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences an unanticipated product defect liability from time to time.', 'While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.', 'The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U. S. , Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products.', 'Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods.', 'In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or

can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.', 'The Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source.', 'When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased.', 'The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.', 'When the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could

understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local brand names.', 'The inability to hire, train, retain, and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth.', 'The People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and India regulate Amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that

fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including as a result of seasonality, promotions, product launches, or unforeseeable events, such as in response to natural or man-made disasters, extreme weather, or geopolitical events.', 'For example, we expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter.', 'Our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth.', 'When we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could materially reduce profitability.', 'We regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season.', 'If too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and services.', 'In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co-sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand.', 'Risks described elsewhere in this Item\\xa01A relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high demand.', 'We generally have payment terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers.', 'As a result of holiday sales, as of December\\xa031 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities).', 'This operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December\\xa031.', 'Our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year, resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances.', 'We Are Impacted by Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sellers The law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled.', 'In addition, governmental agencies have in the past

claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties.', 'Such claims, whether or not meritorious, have in the past, and may in the future, result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or significant payments for damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights.', 'Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.', 'These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims.', '8Table of Contents Our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content.', 'Breach or malfunctioning of the digital rights management technology that we use could subject us to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service.', 'We Have Foreign Exchange Risk The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.', 'Due to these fluctuations, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances.', 'As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased.', 'We also hold cash equivalents and/or

higher transaction fees, and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.', 'In addition, we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties, and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf.', 'Jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing, regulatory inspection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or processing data, and authentication.', 'We are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, international money transfers, privacy, data protection, data security, network security, consumer protection, and electronic fund transfers.', 'If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services.', 'We Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile We have a rapidly evolving business model.', 'The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risks described elsewhere in this Item\\xa01A, as well as:•changes in interest rates;•conditions or trends in the Internet and the industry segments we operate in;•quarterly variations in operating results;•fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for Internet-related companies in

analysts;•changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;•changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and•transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, and speculation.', 'Volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, or both.', 'Legal and Regulatory Risks Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business We are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, digital content, web services, electronic devices,

sanitation standards, the characteristics, legality, and quality of products and services, product labeling, the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems, and other matters.', 'It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, privacy, data protection, data security, network security, and consumer protection apply to aspects of our operations such as the Internet, e-commerce, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, and artificial 13Table of Contentsintelligence technologies and services.', 'A large number of jurisdictions regulate our operations, and the extent, nature, and scope of such regulations is evolving and expanding as the scope of our businesses expand.', 'We are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews and investigations by governments and regulatory authorities under existing laws, regulations, or interpretations or pursuing new and novel approaches to regulate our operations.', 'For example, a number of regulators have opened investigations to assess whether aspects of our operations violate competition rules.', 'Unfavorable regulations, laws, decisions, or interpretations by government or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations, or inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions threatened or initiated by them, could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary fines), diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and services, increase our cost of doing business, require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, damage our reputation, impede our growth, or otherwise have a material effect on our operations.', 'Claims, Litigation, Government Investigations, and Other Proceedings May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations As an innovative company offering a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world, we are regularly subject to actual and threatened claims, litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings, including proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities, involving a wide range of issues, including patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy, data protection, data security, network security, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters.', 'The number and scale of these proceedings have increased over time as our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach and our products, services, and operations have become more complex and available to, and used by, more people.', 'Any of these types of proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, disruption of our operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and other factors.', 'The outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.', 'Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes.', 'Until the final resolution of such matters, we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material.', 'Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.', 'In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings, including as a result of a settlement, could involve licenses, sanctions, consent decrees, or orders requiring us to make substantial future payments, preventing us from offering certain products or services, requiring us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, damaging our reputation, or otherwise having a material effect on our operations.', 'We Are Subject to Product Liability Claims When People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or Manufacture Some of the products we sell or manufacture expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness, death, or environmental or property damage, and can require product recalls or other actions.', 'Third parties who sell products using our services and stores also expose us to product liability claims.', 'Although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all.', 'Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements.', 'In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability.', '14Table of Contents We Face Additional Tax Liabilities and Collection Obligations We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U. S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions.', 'We may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions.', 'Such changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions.', 'An increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services.', 'These include new obligations to collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations.', 'For example, the European Union, certain member states, and other countries have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues.', 'Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely effected by additional taxes of this nature imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies.', 'In some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date.', 'Our tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special or extraterritorial tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, and changes in our tax assets and liabilities and their valuation.', 'In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.', 'Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense, assets, and liabilities.', 'We are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us.', 'Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods.', 'We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals.', 'Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical tax accruals.', 'We Are Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Related Procurement Regulations Our contracts with U. S. , as well as state, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration, and performance.', 'We are subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business.', 'In addition, some of these contracts are subject to periodic funding approval and/or provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause.']\n",

Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involves risks including, but not limited to, the risks described below.', 'Any one of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline, and you may lose all or a part of your investment.', 'Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.', 'Risks Related to Our Industry and Markets If we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets, or to identify new products, services or technologies, our revenue and financial results may be adversely impacted.', 'Our GPU-based visual and accelerated computing platforms address four large markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive.', 'These markets often experience rapid technological change, changes in customer requirements, new product introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards.', 'Our success depends on our ability to identify emerging industry changes and to develop new (or enhance our existing) products, services and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets.', 'Such activities may require considerable technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments.', 'We devote significant resources to the development of technologies and business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history, such as the automotive and data center markets, which presents additional risks to our business.', 'For example, we must continue to accurately forecast demand, scale and optimize utilization in our data center business, and develop and deliver next-generation autonomous driving solutions to our partners and customers or our business could be negatively impacted.', 'We also must continue to scale our networking business following the Mellanox acquisition by leveraging our joint product capabilities and continuing to effectively integrate company processes.', 'We must also continue to develop the infrastructure needed to scale our business in these areas, including customer service and support, e-commerce and intellectual property, or IP, licensing capabilities.', 'If we do not continue to evolve our business, including by developing 13Table of Contentsmarket specific technologies, managing the social and environmental impact of our products and technologies, expanding the ecosystem for our current and future products and technologies, and monetizing and expanding our business in various areas, our financial results could be negatively impacted.', 'We also must meet customer safety and compliance standards, which are subject to change, including those applicable to our automotive solutions and systems.', 'Additionally, we continue to make considerable investments in research and development, which may not produce significant revenue for several years, if at all.', 'If our investments are unsuccessful and we fail to develop new products, services and technologies, or if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, our business, revenue, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.', 'We cannot assure you that our strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers, partners, and ultimately, our shareholders.', 'If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends, or if we do not appropriately adapt our strategies as market conditions evolve, in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities, our business will be harmed.', 'For our products that we do not sell directly to consumers, achieving design wins is an important success factor, including for our interconnect products.', 'Achieving design wins may involve a lengthy process in pursuit of a customer opportunity and depend on our ability to anticipate features and functionality that customers and consumers will demand.', 'Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product.', 'This could result in lost revenue and could weaken our position in future competitive bid selection processes.', 'Unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers.', 'Additionally, if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards, including safety standards, our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies.', 'Furthermore, winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer or that we will realize as much revenue as anticipated, if any.', 'Competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue.', 'Our target markets remain extremely competitive, and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product and/or service offerings, industry standards continue to evolve, customer needs change and new competitors enter these markets.', 'Our competitors’ products, services and technologies may be less costly, or may offer superior functionality or better features, than ours, which may result, among other things, in lower than expected selling prices for our products.', 'In addition, some of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities, have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive IP portfolios and patent protections, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do.', 'These competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends, quickly transition their products, including semiconductor products, to increasingly smaller line width geometries, and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials, which could harm our business.', 'In our networking business, some of our customers are also integrated circuit and switch suppliers and already have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to ours.', 'Licensing our technology and supporting such customers entails the transfer of intellectual property rights that may enable such customers to develop their own products and solutions to replace those we are currently providing to them.', 'Consequently, these customers may become competitors to us.', 'Further, each new design by a customer presents a competitive situation.', 'If we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets, respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this competitive environment, including in significant international markets such as China, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease, which would cause our revenue to decline and cause our results of operations to suffer.', 'In addition, the competitive landscape in our target markets has changed and may continue to evolve due to a trend toward consolidation, which could lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results.', 'Risks Related to Our Supply and Manufacturing We depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test and/or package our products, which reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business.', 'We do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility.', 'Instead, we are dependent on industry-leading foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. , to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques.', 'Similarly, we do not directly assemble, test or package our products, but instead rely on independent subcontractors.', 'In the past we have not had and going forward we may not have long-term commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors.', 'Nevertheless, we may enter into long-term procurement and capacity commitments 14Table of Contentsas our business grows or in periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain.', 'As our business grows, we must continue to scale and adapt our supply chain or it could have an adverse impact on our business.', 'As a result, we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand, scale our supply chain and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:•a lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices, which could be impacted by our failure to correctly estimate demand and to place orders with our suppliers in sufficient quantities and/or in a timely manner;•a failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate, or any, manufacturing or test capacity for our products;•a failure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality, leading-edge process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basis;•a limited number of suppliers, including foundries, assembly and test providers, and memory manufacturers;•loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier;•a lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality; and•delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ orders over our orders or otherwise.', 'In addition, low manufacturing yields could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand, increase manufacturing costs, harm customer or partner relationships, and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results.', 'Manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design, which is developed largely by us, and process technology, which typically is proprietary to the foundry.', 'Low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure.', 'We do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry.', 'As a result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem.', 'We also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements, and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner.', 'In the past, we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products.', 'The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools.', 'If we miss design cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools, we could lose market share and our revenues could decline.', 'If we fail to achieve design wins for our products, our business will be harmed.', 'If our products contain significant defects, we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects, our reputation could be damaged, and we could lose market share.', 'Our products, including both hardware and software offerings, are complex and may contain defects or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system.', 'These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications, including into the automotive market, or as new versions are released.', 'Some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used by customers or the end users of such product.', 'Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our customers or end users to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products or services.', 'Failure of our products to perform to specifications, or other product defects, could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers, the end product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product.', 'Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs, write-off the value of related inventory, cause us to lose market share, and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue.', 'In addition, an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in 15Table of Contentsfailure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins, harm our relationships with customers and partners and harm consumers’ perceptions of our brand.', 'Also, we may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including costs to repair or replace products in the field.', 'A product recall, including automotive recalls or recalls due to a bug in our products, or a significant number of product returns could be expensive, damage our reputation, harm our ability to attract new customers, result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result in litigation against us, such as product liability suits.', 'If a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our business.', 'Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.', 'Risks Related to Our Operating Business If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, our financial results could be harmed.', 'Our products are manufactured based on estimates of customers’ future demand and our manufacturing lead times are very long.', 'This could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or excess inventory, and make our demand forecast more uncertain.', 'We sell many of our products through a channel model, and our channel customers sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers.', 'As a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, retailers, and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the changing demand for our products could impact our financial results.', 'In order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build inventory for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur, may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize, or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pent-up demand.', 'In periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain, we may place non-cancellable inventory orders significantly in advance of our normal lead times, pay premiums or provide deposits to secure normal and incremental future supply, which could negatively impact our financial results.', 'Demand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions, competitor announcements, and competing technologies, all of which can impact the timing and amount of our revenue.', 'For example, our GPUs for gaming are capable of digital currency mining.', 'Demand and use of GPUs for cryptocurrency has fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to change quickly.', 'Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies, can impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products.', 'Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.', '0 standard may also create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs and may reduce demand for our new GPUs.', 'Additionally, consumer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased demand for our Gaming, Data Center and mobile workstation and laptop products and suppressed corporate demand for desktop workstations, has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand, and these challenges may be more pronounced in the future if and when the effects of the pandemic subside.', 'In estimating demand, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect.', 'If we are unable to accurately anticipate demand for our products, our business and financial results could be adversely impacted.', 'Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include:•changes in business and economic conditions, including downturns in our target markets and/or overall economy;•changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in the credit market;•a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products;•a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;•our introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products; •less demand than expected for newly-introduced products; or•increased competition, including competitive pricing actions.', 'The cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory, which could adversely affect our gross margins.', 'In addition, because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter, we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals.', 'We could be required to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or excess inventory, and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand, any of which could harm our financial results.', \"16Table of Contents Conversely, if we underestimate our customers' demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers' orders on a timely basis.\", 'We may also face supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events.', 'In such cases, even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner.', \"If we fail to fulfill our customers' orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged.\", 'System security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation.', 'Security breaches, computer malware, phishing, and cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years.', 'These threats are constantly evolving, making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures.', 'These attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and are expected to occur in the future.', 'Experienced computer programmers, hackers and employees may penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information, or that of our employees or third parties.', 'These attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns.', 'These hackers may also develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products, including consumer and automotive products, where we utilize over-the-air updates to improve functionality over time.', 'For portions of our IT infrastructure, including business management and communication software products, we rely on products and services provided by third parties.', 'These providers may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems.', 'For example, in 2020, Solar Winds Inc. , one of our third party software service providers, was subject to a data security breach.', 'To date, our investigations of this breach, which were supported by a third party expert, have not identified any adverse impact to NVIDIA.', 'Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, such as actions by an employee with access to our systems.', 'To defend against security threats, both to our internal systems and those of our customers, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which may result in increased expenses.', 'We must also continue to develop security measures within NVIDIA, ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers or our business could be negatively impacted.', 'Actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our partners, our customers or third parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability, paying damages, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business.', 'Our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be successful.', 'We may experience interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers.', 'Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions.', 'Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.', 'Business disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs.', 'Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, outages at cloud service providers, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, medical epidemics or pandemics (including, but not limited to, COVID-19) and other natural or man-made disasters, catastrophic events or climate change.', 'The occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses, a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses.', 'Any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations.', 'Such risks are discussed further in the risk factor “The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.', '” Our corporate headquarters, and a portion of our research and development activities, are located in California, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity.', 'In addition, a large portion of our current data center capacity is located in California, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas.', 'The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Israel and Korea.', 'Additionally, a significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through Hong Kong, Israel and Taiwan.', 'Geopolitical change or changes in government regulations and policies in the United States or abroad may result in changing regulatory requirements, trade policies, import duties and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability.', 'In particular, revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement 17Table of Contentscould result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments.', 'For example, regulations to implement the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 could have an adverse effect on our business plans.', 'Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel.', 'In addition, geopolitical and domestic political developments, such as existing and potential trade wars, political or social unrest, elections and post-election developments, and other events beyond our control, can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets.', 'Political instability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would also likely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.', 'Our operations could be harmed if manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, other negative impacts from climate change, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues.', 'The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown.', 'In the event a major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event affects us or the third-party systems on which we rely, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations.', 'All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.', 'The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.', 'COVID-19 has spread worldwide, resulting in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the disease, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns.', 'These measures have impacted, and may further impact, our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers and our partners, and those of our respective vendors and suppliers (including our subcontractors and third-party contract manufacturers).', 'Our critical business operations, including our headquarters, most of our finished goods inventory and many of our key suppliers are located in regions which have been impacted by COVID-19.', 'Our customers and suppliers worldwide have also been affected and may continue to be affected by COVID-19 related restrictions and closures.', 'The COVID-19 pandemic has increased economic and demand uncertainty.', 'It continues to affect our business in both positive and negative ways, and there is uncertainty around their duration and impact.', 'In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, our Gaming and Data Center market platforms benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work, learn, and play from home.', 'Our Professional Visualization market platform benefited from work-from-home trends in mobile workstations and desktop workstation demand has started to recover, although not back to pre-COVID levels.', 'In our Automotive market platform, COVID-19 did not have a significant impact on demand in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021.', 'In some regions, markets, or industries, where COVID-19 has driven an increase in sales for our products, the demand may not be sustainable if conditions change.', 'Additionally, stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity and components in our supply chain, particularly in Gaming, which could cause us to order an excess amount if

finished goods product distribution occurs through Hong Kong, Israel and Taiwan.', 'Additionally, our headquarters is located in California.', 'Each of these countries and locations has been affected by the pandemic and has taken measures to try to contain it, including restrictions on manufacturing facilities, commerce, travel, on our support operations or workforce, or on our customers,

transportation, such as reduced availability or increased cost of air transport, port closures and increased border controls or closures, could limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.', 'The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel, mandatory work-from-home policies and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take further actions as required by government authorities and regulations or that

measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the disease, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed.', 'While the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business is difficult to assess or predict, the pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital or our customers’ ability to pay us for past or future purchases, which could negatively affect our liquidity.', 'A recession or financial market correction resulting from the lack of containment and spread of COVID-19 could impact overall technology spending, adversely affecting demand for our products, our business and the value of our common stock.', 'The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change.', 'The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial

announced our agreement to acquire all allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $40 billion.', 'The Mellanox acquisition, the planned Arm acquisition and future acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks, and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products, and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results.', 'Given that our resources are limited, our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives.', 'Furthermore, if we are unable to complete acquisitions in a timely manner, including due to delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve, making the acquisition less attractive, and other changes can take place which could jeopardize or reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business.', 'In addition, we have made and may in the future make strategic investments in private companies and may not realize a return on our investments.', 'Additional risks related to the Mellanox acquisition,

the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results.', '23Table of Contents Our success depends in part on protecting our intellectual property.', 'To accomplish this, we rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements, and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally.', 'We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights that are valuable to our business.', 'The laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.', 'This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely.', 'In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in research and development, product development, and marketing could be reduced.', 'We also may face risks to our

defending legal claims.', 'Worldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection, which continue to evolve and apply to our business.', 'For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which required companies to meet requirements effective as of May 2018 regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to access, correct and delete such data about themselves.', 'Failure to meet GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue.', 'In addition, California adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020.', 'The CCPA gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared.', 'Violations of the CCPA carry substantial civil penalties and the law creates a private right of action for certain data breaches, which is expected to increase data breach litigation.', 'California’s privacy laws will expand substantially effective January 1, 2023 as a result of California voters approving the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, in the November 2020 election.', 'The CPRA will, among other things, restrict use of certain categories of sensitive personal information; further restrict the use of cross-contextual advertising techniques; establish restrictions on the retention of personal information; expand the types of data breaches subject to the private right of action; and establish the California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law, as well as impose administrative fines.', 'Since the enactment of the CCPA, more than half of the states in the United States and the United States Congress have considered proposed privacy legislation, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States.', 'The interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid, and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices.', 'If so, we may be ordered to change our data practices and/or be fined.',

the allocation of revenue and expenses in different jurisdictions.', 'Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities.', 'We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions.', 'For example, we are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019 and under audit in the United Kingdom, Germany, Israel and India.', 'Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may 24Table of Contentsdisagree with certain positions we have taken, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.', 'Further, changes in United States federal, and state or international tax laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows, as we experienced in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the TCJA.', 'Our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, changes in our business or statutory rates, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in available tax credits, the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the period in which they occur, the impact of accounting for business combinations, shifts in the amount of earnings in the United States compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax, changes in the domestic or international organization of our business and structure, as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits.', 'Any changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income.', 'Our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.', 'We currently and may in the future face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business on a global basis.', 'For example, we are currently defending ourselves in a shareholder lawsuit claiming that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018.', 'In addition, multiple stockholders, purporting to act on our behalf, filed derivative lawsuits seeking to assert claims on our behalf against the members of our board of directors and certain officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand.', 'Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents.', 'An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends.', 'In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations.', 'In addition, the laws and regulations our business is subject to are complex and change frequently.', 'We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with changes in, or remedy violations of, these laws

combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders.', 'In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock.', 'These provisions include the following:•the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval;•the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent;•advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals;•the ability of our Board of Directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approval;•a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;•the inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of

significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption.', 'In an effort to contain COVID-19 or slow its spread, governments around the world have enacted various measures, some of which have been subsequently rescinded, modified or reinstated, including orders to close all businesses not deemed “essential,” isolate residents to their homes or places of residence, and practice social

negatively impact consumer demand for and member retention to our service and the number of paid memberships.', 'Temporary production pauses or permanent shutdowns in production could result in content asset impairments or other charges and will change the timing and amount of cash outflows associated with production activity.', 'The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and the various responses to it impacts our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the availability and cost to access the capital markets; the effect on our customers and customer demand for and ability to pay for our services; disruptions or restrictions on our employees’ ability to work and travel; and any stoppages, disruptions or increased costs associated with our development, production, post-production, marketing and distribution of original programming.', 'During the COVID-19 crisis, we may not be able to provide the same level of customer service and product features that our members are used to which could negatively impact their perception of our service resulting in an increase in cancellations.', 'Furthermore, given increased government expenditures associated with their COVID-19 response, we could see increased government obligations which could negatively impact our results of operations.', 'If we need to access the capital markets, there can be no assurance that financing may be available on attractive terms, if at all.', 'We will continue to actively monitor the issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations, including content production, as may be required by federal, state, local or foreign authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and stockholders.', 'It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our customers, suppliers or vendors, or on our financial results.', 'The COVID-19 pandemic also led to an increase in our net paid membership additions relative to our quarterly forecast and historic trends in the first half of 2020, and slower net paid membership additions in the second half of 2020 relative to historic trends.', 'These results, as well as those of other metrics such as revenues, operating margins, net income, net cash provided by operating activities and other financial and operating data, may not be indicative of results for future periods.', 'In addition to the potential direct impacts to our business, the global economy is likely to be significantly weakened as a result of the actions taken in response to COVID-19.', 'To the extent that such a weakened global economy impacts consumers’ ability or willingness to pay for our service or vendors’ ability to provide services to us, especially those related to our content productions, we could see our business and results of operation negatively impacted.', '4Table of Contents If our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.', 'We have experienced significant membership growth over the past several years.', 'Our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members with compelling content choices, effectively market our service, as well as provide a quality experience for selecting and viewing TV series, documentaries and feature films.', 'Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain memberships.', 'Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as MVPDs, and streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), as well as video gaming providers and more broadly other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time.', 'If consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members.', 'We may, from time to time, adjust our membership pricing or our pricing model itself, which may not be well-received by consumers, and which may result in existing members canceling our service or fewer new members joining our service.', 'In addition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members.', 'If our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful, we may not be able to attract members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected.', 'Members cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to cut household expenses, availability of content is unsatisfactory, competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved.', 'We must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base.', 'While we permit multiple users within the same household to share a single account for non-commercial purposes, if multi-household usage is abused or if our efforts to restrict multi-household usage are ineffective, our ability to add new members may be hindered and our results of operations may be adversely impacted.', 'If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted.', 'If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships, our business will be adversely affected.', 'Further, if excessive numbers of members cancel our service, we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these members with new members.', 'Changes in competitive offerings for entertainment video, including the potential rapid adoption of piracy-based video offerings, could adversely impact our business.', 'The market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change.', 'Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video.', 'The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models.', 'All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market.', 'Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free.', 'Furthermore, in light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth.', 'Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their streaming video offerings.', 'Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content and significant financial, marketing and other resources.', 'They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing.', 'New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video.', 'Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.', 'If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.', 'We face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through our service.', 'As a producer and distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark

production, such as completion and key talent risk.', 'Negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions.', 'We contract with third parties related to the development, production, marketing and distribution of our original programming.', 'We may face potential liability or may suffer losses in connection with these arrangements, including but not limited to if such third parties violate applicable law, become insolvent or engage in fraudulent behavior.', 'To the extent we create

for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removed from our service, or if we become liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer.', 'Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations.', 'We may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.', 'If we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be

including being required to remove such content from our service, our entire service could be banned and/or become subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny across our business and operations.', 'We could also face boycotts which could adversely affect our business.', 'Furthermore, to the extent our response to government action or our marketing, customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative reaction, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted.', 'With newer markets, we also need to establish our reputation with consumers and to the extent we are not successful in creating positive impressions, our business in these newer markets may be adversely impacted.', 'Changes in how we market our service could adversely affect our marketing expenses and membership levels may be adversely affected.', 'We utilize a broad mix of marketing and public relations programs, including social media

expected acquisition and retention benefits and our business may be adversely affected.', 'We rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices.', 'We currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internet-connected devices, including TVs, digital video players, television set-top boxes and mobile devices.', 'We have agreements with various cable, satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service available through the television set-top boxes of these service providers, some of whom may have investments in competing streaming content providers.', 'In many instances, our agreements also include provisions by which the partner bills consumers directly for the Netflix service or otherwise offers services

licensing, regulatory, business or other impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members via these devices, our ability to retain members and grow our business could be adversely impacted.', 'Our agreements with our partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if, upon expiration, a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us, which terms may include the degree of accessibility and prominence of our service.', 'Furthermore, devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than Netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices’ performance, the connection between these devices and Netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward Netflix and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business.', 'In addition, technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices, or may lead to us to stop supporting the delivery of our service on certain legacy devices.', \"If partners do not update

processing risk.', 'Our members pay for our service using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, gift cards, prepaid cards, direct debit, online wallets and direct carrier and partner billing.', 'We rely on internal systems as well as those of third parties to process payment.', 'Acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules and regulations, including additional authentication requirements for certain payment methods, and require payment of interchange and other fees.', 'To the extent there are increases in payment processing fees, material changes in the payment ecosystem, such as large re-issuances of payment cards, delays in receiving payments from payment processors, changes to rules or regulations concerning payments, loss of payment partners and/or disruptions or failures in our payment processing systems, partner systems or payment products, including products we use to update payment information, our revenue, operating expenses and results of operation could be adversely impacted.', 'In certain instances, we leverage third parties such as our cable and other partners to bill subscribers on our behalf.', 'If these third parties become unwilling or unable to continue processing payments on our behalf, we would have to transition subscribers or otherwise find alternative methods of collecting payments, which could adversely impact member acquisition and retention.', 'In addition, from time to time, we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods, which could impact our results of operations and if not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of our service.', 'If we are unable to maintain our fraud and chargeback rate at acceptable levels, card networks may impose fines, our card approval rate may be impacted and we may be subject to additional card authentication requirements.', 'The termination of our ability to process payments on any major payment

which we conduct our business, or incur greater operating expenses.', 'The adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business.', 'As our service and others like us gain traction in international markets, governments are increasingly looking to introduce new or extend legacy regulations to these services, in particular those related to broadcast media and tax.', 'For example, recent changes to European law enables individual member states to impose levies and other financial obligations on media operators located outside their jurisdiction.', '7Table of Contents We anticipate that several jurisdictions may, over time, impose greater financial and regulatory obligations on us.', 'In addition, the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws, which may impose additional burdens on us.', 'If we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation, this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model.', 'Changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including laws impacting net neutrality, could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business.', 'Certain laws intended to prevent network operators from discriminating against the legal traffic that traverse their networks have been implemented in many countries, including across the European Union.', 'In others, the laws may be nascent or non-existent.', 'Furthermore, favorable laws may change, including for example, in the United States where net neutrality regulations were repealed.', 'Given uncertainty around these rules, including changing interpretations, amendments or repeal, coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business.', 'Risks Related to Intellectual Property If studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or

distribute.', 'The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary.', 'As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies.', 'If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase.', 'Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly.', 'Because of these provisions as well as other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice.', 'As

organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business.', 'Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation as well as negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us.', 'Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs.', 'Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other rights holders could expose us to greater distribution expenses.', 'If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to

of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize ads could harm our business.', 'We generated over 80% of total revenues from the display of ads online in 2020.', 'Many of our advertisers, companies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their contracts with us at any time.', 'These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective monetization) than their available alternatives.', 'Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, as well as changes to other companies’ advertising and/or data privacy practices may affect the advertising that we are able to provide, which could harm our business.', 'In addition, technologies have been developed that make customized ads more difficult or that block the display of ads altogether and some providers of online services have integrated technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-party digital advertising.', 'Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.', 'In addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns.', 'Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including COVID-19 and its effects on the global economy (as discussed in greater detail in our COVID-19 risk factor under ‘General Risks’ below), have impacted the demand for advertising and resulted in fluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, and could have an adverse impact on such demand and spend, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.', 'We face intense competition.', 'If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our business and operating results.', 'Our business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive.', 'Our businesses face changing technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services.', 'To compete successfully, we must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, and technologies in a timely manner.', 'As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services.', 'We must continue to invest significant resources in research and development, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our technology and new and existing products and services.', 'We have many competitors in different industries.', 'Our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups.', 'Some competitors have longer operating histories and well established relationships in various sectors.', 'They can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions, continuing to invest heavily in research and development and in talent, aggressively initiating intellectual property claims (whether or not meritorious), and continuing to compete aggressively for users, advertisers, customers, and content providers.', 'Further, discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to aggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny, thereby affording them competitive advantages.', 'Our competitors may also be able to innovate and provide

otherwise accomplish their objectives.', 'Within Google Services, we continue to invest heavily in hardware, including our smartphones and home devices, which is a highly competitive market with

mix, geographic mix, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix, and property mix and an increasing competition for advertising may also affect our advertising revenue growth rate.', 'We may also experience a decline in our revenue growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, if there is a decrease in the rate of adoption of our products, services, and technologies, or due to deceleration or decline in demand for devices used to access our services, among other factors.', 'In addition, COVID-19 and its effects on the global economy has impacted and may continue to adversely impact our revenue growth rate (as discussed in greater detail in our COVID-19 risk factor under ‘General Risks’ below).', 'In addition to a decline in our revenue growth rate, we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors, such as the continued expansion of our business into new fields, including products and services such as hardware, Google Cloud, and subscription products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may have margins lower than those we generate from advertising.', 'We may also experience downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations, increasing competition and increased costs for many aspects of our business, including within advertising where changes such as device mix, property mix, and partner agreements can affect margin.', 'The margin we earn on revenues generated from our Google Network Members could also decrease in the future if we

may not correlate to changes in revenues.', 'Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance.', 'Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services and brands as well as affect our ability to compete.', 'Our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us.', 'Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services, and technologies.', 'For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet.', 'Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective.', 'Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations.', 'Moreover, we may not have adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important.', 'Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.', 'We also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets.', 'The secrecy of such trade secrets and other sensitive information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets.', 'We also face risks associated with our trademarks.', 'For example, there is a risk that the word “Google” could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word “search.', '” Some courts have ruled that \"Google\" is a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the United States, may reach a different determination.', 'If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the word “Google” to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.', 'Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete.', 'Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming.', 'Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.', 'Our business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners.', 'Our strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business.', 'Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Google Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innovative products that better serve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners.', 'Our brands may be negatively affected by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy and security issues and developments, and product or technical performance failures.', 'For example, if we fail to appropriately respond to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable practices by advertisers, or to otherwise adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our brands.', 'Furthermore, failure to maintain and enhance equity in our brands may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.', 'Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality, innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a range of settings.', 'We face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that, if not properly managed, could harm our financial condition, operating results, and prospects.', 'We face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability to supply both our products and our internet-based services.', 'We rely on other companies to manufacture many of our finished products, to design certain of our components and parts, and to

General Risks The continuing impacts of COVID-19 are highly unpredictable and could be significant, and may have an adverse effect on our business, operations and our future financial performance.', 'Since COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, governments and municipalities around the world have instituted measures in an effort to control the spread of COVID-19, including quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, school closings, travel restrictions, and closure of non-essential businesses.', 'The macroeconomic impacts on our business continue to evolve and be unpredictable and may continue to adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance.', 'As a result of the scale of the ongoing pandemic and the speed at which the global community has been impacted, our revenue growth rate and expense as a percentage of our revenues in future periods may differ significantly from our historical rate, and our future operating results may fall below expectations.', 'The future impacts of the ongoing pandemic on our business, operations and future financial performance could include, but are not limited to:•Significant decline in advertising revenues as advertiser spending slows due to an economic downturn.', 'This decline in advertising revenues could persist through and beyond a recessionary period.', 'In addition, we may experience a significant and prolonged shift in user behavior such as a shift in interests to less commercial topics.', '•Significant decline in other revenues due to a decline or shifts in customer demand.', 'For example, if consumer demand for electronics significantly declines, our hardware revenues could be significantly impacted.', '•Adverse impacts to our operating income, operating margin, net income, EPS and respective growth rates - particularly if expenses do not decrease across Alphabet at the same pace as revenue declines.', 'Many of our expenses are less variable in nature and/or may not correlate to changes in revenues, including costs associated with our data centers and facilities as well as employee compensation.', 'As such, we may not be able to decrease them significantly in the short-term, or we may choose not to significantly reduce them in an effort to remain focused on long-term outlook and investment opportunities.', '•Significant decline in our operating cash flows as a result of decreased advertiser spending and deterioration in the credit quality and liquidity of our customers, which could adversely affect our accounts receivable.', 'Investing cash flows could decrease due to slowing spend on data center and facilities construction projects due to a slowing or stopping of construction or significant restrictions placed on construction.', '•The prolonged and broad-based shift to a remote working environment continues to create inherent productivity, connectivity, and oversight challenges and could affect our ability to enhance, develop and support existing products and services, detect and prevent spam and problematic content, hold product sales and marketing events, and generate new sales leads, among others.', 'In addition, the changed environment under which we are operating could have an effect on our internal controls over financial reporting as well as our ability to meet a number of our compliance requirements in a timely or quality manner.', 'Additional and/or extended, governmental lockdowns, restrictions or new regulations could significantly impact the ability of our employees and vendors to work productively.', 'Governmental restrictions have been globally inconsistent and it remains unclear when a return to worksite locations or travel will be permitted or what restrictions will be in place in those environments.', 'As we prepare to return our workforce in more locations back to the office in 2021, we may experience increased costs as we prepare our facilities for a safe return to work environment and experiment with hybrid work models, in addition to potential effects on our ability to compete effectively and maintain our corporate culture.', 'Our operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.', 'Our operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many outside of our control.', 'As a result, comparing our operating results (including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues) on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance.', 'Our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations.', 'Any of these events could cause our stock price to fall.', 'Each of the risk factors listed under this Item 1A in addition to the following factors may affect our operating results:•Our ability to attract user and/or customer adoption of, and generate significant revenues from, new products, services, and technologies in which we have invested considerable time and resources.', \"21Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. •Our ability to monetize traffic on

service interruptions.', '•The seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising spending, and underlying business trends such as traditional retail seasonality.', 'Our rapid growth has tended to mask the cyclicality and seasonality of our business.', 'As our growth rate has slowed, the cyclicality and seasonality in our business has become more pronounced and caused our operating results to fluctuate.', '•Geopolitical events, including trade disputes.', '•Changes in global business or macroeconomic conditions.', 'Acquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other consequences that may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.', 'Acquisitions, joint ventures, investments and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results.', 'We expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic transactions, which could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures.', 'Some of the areas where we face risks include:•Diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and other strategic transactions.', '•Failure to successfully integrate and further develop the acquired business or technology.', '•Implementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company.', '•Integration of the acquired company’s accounting, human resource, and other administrative systems, and coordination of product, engineering, and sales and marketing functions.', '•Transition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms.', '•Failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions placed upon approval that could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction.', '•In the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.', '•Cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization, and retention of employees from the businesses we acquire.', '•Liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, data privacy and security issues, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities.', '•Litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders, or other third parties.', 'Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and other strategic transactions could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.', 'Our acquisitions and other strategic transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and/or purchased long-lived assets, and restructuring charges, any of which could harm our financial condition or operating results.', '22Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.

predict.', 'The following discussion, as well as our “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” discussion in Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, highlights some of these risks.', 'The risks described below are not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities.', 'Business and Operational Risks\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected how we and our customers are operating our respective businesses, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations remains uncertain.', 'The COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread have materially affected how we, our customers, partners and suppliers are operating our businesses.', 'Our operations have been negatively affected by a range of external factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic that are not within our control.', 'For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has led governments to implement preventative measures to contain or control further spread of the virus, such as travel restrictions, prohibitions of non-essential activities, quarantines, work-from-home directives and shelter-in-place orders.', 'These preventative measures led to sharp reductions in demand in certain industries in which our customers operate.', 'It is not clear what long-term effects the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, including the effects on our customers and prospects.', 'If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic effectively, our business will be harmed.', 'During fiscal 2021, we cancelled some customer events and transformed others, including Oracle Open World, to virtual events.', 'Our shift to creating virtual customer events may not be successful and we may not be able to showcase our products as well as we have historically done through in-person events, or generate the same customer interest, opportunities and leads through these virtual events.', 'If we attempt to reintroduce large in-person events, we may not be able to do so successfully and our customers may not be able or willing to attend them.', 'The conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic initially adversely affected our customers’ willingness to purchase our products, delayed prospective customers’ purchasing decisions and in certain cases, resulted in delayed payments by existing customers.', 'There have also been, and likely will continue to be, delays in our supply chain.', 'The negative impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the broader global economy and related impacts on our customers’ business operations and their demand for our products may continue into future fiscal periods.', 'The COVID-19 pandemic may also heighten other risks described in this Risk Factors section.', 'Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and services, integrate acquired products and services and enhance our existing products and services.', 'Rapid technological advances, intense competition, changing delivery models and evolving standards in computer hardware and software development and communications infrastructure, changing and increasingly sophisticated customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the industries in which we compete.', 'If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services, enhance and improve our product offerings and support services in a timely manner or position and price our products and services to meet demand, customers may not purchase or subscribe to our license, hardware or cloud offerings or renew license support, hardware support or cloud subscriptions contracts.', 'Renewals of these contracts are important to the growth of our business.', 'In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop new products will allow us to compete effectively for business opportunities in emerging areas.', 'We have continued to refresh and release new offerings of our cloud products and services.', 'Machine learning and artificial intelligence

collectively, Oracle Cloud Services) offerings, may adversely affect our revenues and profitability.', 'We provide our cloud and other offerings to customers worldwide via deployment models that best suit their needs, including via our cloud-based Saa S and Iaa S offerings.', 'As these business models continue to evolve, we may not be able to compete effectively, generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our cloud offerings.', 'Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud and Saa S delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our cloud and license offerings.', 'If we do not successfully execute our cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloud computing needs of our customers, our reputation as a cloud services provider could be harmed and our revenues and profitability could decline.', 'As customer demand for our cloud offerings increases, we experience volatility in our reported revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing of revenue recognition between our cloud license and on-premise license, and hardware product arrangements relative to our cloud offering arrangements.', 'Customers generally purchase our cloud offerings on a subscription basis and revenues from these offerings are generally recognized ratably over the terms of the subscriptions.', 'Consequently, any deterioration in sales activity associated with our cloud offerings may not be immediately observable in our consolidated statement of operations.', 'This is in contrast to revenues associated with our license and hardware product arrangements, which are generally recognized in full at the time of delivery of the related licenses and hardware products.', 'In addition, we may not be able to accurately anticipate customer transition from or be able to sufficiently backfill reduced customer demand for our license, hardware and support offerings relative to the expected increase in customer adoption of and demand for our Oracle Cloud Services, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.', 'We might experience significant coding, manufacturing or configuration errors in our cloud, license and hardware offerings.', 'Despite testing prior to the release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service, our cloud, license and hardware offerings sometimes contain coding, manufacturing or configuration errors that can impact their function, performance and security, and result in other negative consequences.', 'The detection and correction of any errors in released cloud, license or hardware offerings can be time consuming and costly.', 'Errors in our cloud, license or hardware offerings could affect their ability to properly function, integrate or operate with other cloud, license or hardware offerings, could result in service interruptions, delays or outages of our cloud offerings, could create security vulnerabilities in our products or services, could delay the development or release of new products or services or new versions of products or services, and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products or services.', 'This includes third-party software products or services incorporated into our own.', 'If we experience any of these errors, or if there are delays in releasing our cloud, license or hardware offerings or new versions of these offerings, our sales could be affected and revenues could decline.', 'In addition, we run Oracle’s business operations as well as cloud and other services that we offer to our customers on our products and networks.', 'Therefore, any flaws could affect our and our customers’ abilities to conduct business operations and to ensure accuracy in financial processes and reporting, and may result in unanticipated costs.', 'Enterprise customers rely on our cloud, license and hardware offerings and related services to run their businesses and errors in our cloud,

our future sales.', '19\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\xa0\\nIf we are unable to compete effectively, the results of operations and prospects for our business could be harmed.', 'We face intense competition in all aspects of our business.', 'The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technology evolves and as delivery models change.', 'Many vendors spend amounts in excess of what Oracle spends to develop and market applications and infrastructure technologies including databases, middleware products, application development tools, business applications, collaboration products and business intelligence, compute, storage and networking products, among others, which compete with Oracle applications and infrastructure offerings.', 'Use of our competitors’ technologies influences a customer’s purchasing decision or creates an environment that makes it less efficient to utilize or migrate to Oracle products and services.', 'Our competitors may also adopt business practices that provide customers access to competing products and services at a risk profile that we may not generally find acceptable, which may convince customers to purchase competitor products and services.', 'We could lose customers if our competitors introduce new competitive products, add new functionality, acquire competitive products, reduce prices, better execute on their sales and marketing strategies, offer more flexible business practices or form strategic alliances with other companies.', 'Mergers, consolidations or alliances among our competitors, or acquisitions of our competitors by large companies, may result in increased competition.', 'We may also face increasing competition from open source software initiatives in which competitors may provide software and intellectual property for free.', 'Existing or new competitors could gain sales opportunities or customers at our expense.', 'We may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully.', 'The intense competition we face in the sales of our products and services and general economic and business conditions could put pressure on us to change our prices.', 'If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable, we may need to lower prices, introduce pricing models and offerings that are less favorable to us, or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully.', 'Any such changes may reduce revenues and margins and could adversely affect operating results.', 'Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our other cloud and license, hardware and services offerings, and we may also incur increased cloud delivery expenses as we expand our cloud operations and update our infrastructure, all of which could reduce our revenues and/or profitability.', 'Our license support fees and hardware support fees are generally priced as a percentage of our net license fees and net new hardware products fees, respectively.', 'Our competitors may offer lower pricing on their support offerings, which could put pressure on us to further discount our offerings.', 'Changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies.', 'Some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy, commit to large customer deployments at prices that are unprofitable, or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations.', 'These practices could, over time, significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain of our products.', 'If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in customer demand, our revenues could decrease.', 'The increase in open source software distribution may also cause us to change our pricing models.', 'Any failure to offer high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results.', 'Our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications and infrastructure offerings.', 'We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services or may be inefficient in our resolution of customer support issues.', 'Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results.', 'Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality technical support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell and renew our applications and infrastructure offerings to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results, and financial position.', 'Our cloud offerings and hardware offerings are complex, and if we cannot successfully manage this complexity, the results of these businesses will suffer.', 'We depend on suppliers to develop, manufacture and deliver on a timely basis the necessary technologies and components for our hardware products that we market and sell to our customers and that we use as a part of our cloud infrastructure to deliver our cloud offerings, and there are some technologies and components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price, quality, technology, \\n20\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\xa0\\navailability or other business constraints.', 'As a result, our supply chain operations could be disrupted or negatively impacted by industry consolidation and component constraints or shortages, natural disasters, political unrest, public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, changes to trade policies, port stoppages or other transportation disruptions or slowdowns, or other factors affecting the countries or regions where these single source component vendors are located or where the products are being shipped.', 'We may be unable to purchase these items from the respective single vendors on acceptable terms or may experience significant shortages, delays or quality issues in the delivery of necessary technologies, parts or components from a particular vendor.', 'If one or more of the risks described above occurs, our cloud and license business and hardware business and related operating results could be materially and adversely affected.', 'We are susceptible to third-party manufacturing and logistics delays, which could result in the loss of sales and customers.', 'We outsource a significant majority of our manufacturing, assembly, delivery and technology of, and certain component designs for, our hardware products to a variety of companies, many of which are located outside the U. S. From time to time, these partners experience production problems or delays or cannot meet our demand for products.', 'To reduce this risk, we continue to explore additional third-party manufacturing partners to drive supply chain continuity, but finding additional manufacturing sources in a timely and cost-effective manner is difficult.', 'Third-party manufacturing and logistics delays attributable to the effects of COVID-19 caused a loss of sales during our fiscal 2021.', 'Ongoing or future delays in manufacturing could cause the loss of additional sales, delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware products expenses, all of which could adversely affect the margins of our cloud and license business and hardware business.', 'These challenges could arise if we alter our manufacturing strategies, suppliers, or locations.', 'Our hardware revenues and profitability have declined and could continue to decline.', 'Our hardware business may adversely affect our total revenues and overall profitability and related growth rates.', 'We may not achieve our estimated revenue, profit or other financial projections with respect to our hardware business in a timely manner or at all due to a number of factors, including:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n•\\n\\nchanges in our hardware offerings, technologies and strategies, including shifting factory locations,

to our workforce in response to management changes, product changes, performance issues, change in strategies, acquisitions and other internal and external considerations.', 'These types of restructurings have resulted in increased restructuring costs and temporary reduced productivity while the employees adjusted to their new roles and responsibilities.', 'In addition, we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth, resource redeployment or cost savings benefits of these \\n21\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\xa0\\nrestructurings, or may not do so within the expected timeframe.', 'These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings and our revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected.', 'We may lose key employees or may be unable to hire enough qualified employees.', 'We rely on hiring qualified employees and the continued service of our senior management, including our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Technology Officer and founder; our Chief Executive Officer; other members of our executive team; and other key employees.', 'In the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business, product development, technical and other personnel.', 'In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to ensure the safety of our employees, we have temporarily closed the majority of our offices.', 'In fiscal 2021, we moved our headquarters to Austin, Texas and announced a modern approach to work that may provide our employees more flexibility to choose where and how to work.', 'Depending on their role, this means that, when our offices reopen after the COVID-19 pandemic, many employees can choose their office location, as well as continue to work from home some or all the time.', 'While we believe this may help us engage with a wider pool of talent and may help to retain employees who want or need more flexibility, it could negatively impact employee productivity and it may present risks for our real estate portfolio and strategy.', 'We intend to reopen our offices when it is safe to do so and local requirements

Dollars and in terms of actual demand for our products and services as certain of these products may become relatively more expensive for foreign currency-based enterprises to purchase.', 'In addition, currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the U. S. Generally, our reported revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens.', 'In addition, our reported assets generally are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies as a portion of our consolidated cash and bank deposits, among other assets, are held in foreign currencies and reported in U. S. Dollars.', 'In addition, we incur foreign currency transaction gains and losses, primarily related to sublicense fees and other intercompany agreements among us and our subsidiaries that we expect to cash settle in the near term, which are charged to earnings in the period incurred.', 'We have a program which primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the risks associated with certain foreign currency exposures.', 'We may suspend the program from time to time.', 'As part of this program, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset at least in part by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in an effort to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction gains or losses.', 'A large portion of our consolidated operations are international, and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts.', 'For example, we will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost-effective to hedge our foreign currency exposures, if our hedging efforts are ineffective, or should we suspend our foreign currency forward contract program.', 'Our ultimate realized \\n30\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\xa0\\nloss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and any related fees paid to purchase such contracts, and other factors.', 'All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.', 'We have incurred foreign currency losses associated with the devaluation of currencies in certain highly inflationary economies relative to the U. S. Dollar.', 'We could incur future losses in emerging market countries where we do business should their currencies become designated as highly inflationary.', 'There are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness.', 'As of May 31, 2021, we had an aggregate of $84.', '2 billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between calendar year 2021 and calendar year 2061, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future.', 'Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this section.', 'There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.', 'We may also need to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures.', 'There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt.', 'Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase.', 'Should we incur future increases in interest expense, our ability to utilize certain of our foreign tax credits to reduce our U. S. federal income tax could be limited, which could unfavorably affect our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate.', 'In addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest amounts we pay on certain outstanding or future debt.', 'These risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.', 'Risks Related to Our Common Stock\\nOur stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value.', 'All of the factors discussed within this Risk Factors section could affect our stock price.', 'The timing of announcements in the public market by us or by our competitors regarding new cloud services, products, product enhancements, technological advances, acquisitions or major transactions could also affect our stock price.', 'Changes in the amounts and frequency of share repurchases or dividends could affect our stock price.', 'Our stock price could also be affected by factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, among others: speculation in the press, social media and the analyst community, changes in recommendations or earnings related estimates by financial analysts, changes in investors’ or analysts’ valuation measures for our stock, negative analyst surveys or channel check surveys, earnings announcements where our financial results differ from our guidance or investors’ expectations, our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance.', 'The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.', 'A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.', 'We cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.', 'In fiscal 2021, our Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program totaling $20.', '0 billion.', 'The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares.', 'Our repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time and, even if fully implemented, may not enhance long-term stockholder value.', '31\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nIndex to Financial Statements\\n\\xa0\\nGeneral Risks\\nEconomic, political and market conditions can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability, which in turn could adversely affect our stock price.', 'Our business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting.', 'These include: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n•\\n\\ngeneral economic and business conditions;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n•\\n\\noverall demand for enterprise cloud, license and hardware products and services;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n•\\n\\ngovernmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities; and\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n•\\n\\ngeneral legal, regulatory and political developments.', 'Macroeconomic developments such as the global economic effects resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the United Kingdom leaving the EU (Brexit), evolving trade policies between the U.

actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.', 'Risks Related to our Business and Industry Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting containment measures have caused economic and financial disruptions globally, including in most of the regions in which we sell our products and services and conduct our business operations.', 'In the second half of fiscal 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on our financial results and business operations, with a significant impact in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 on our supply chain where we saw manufacturing challenges and component constraints.', 'We continue to address these supply chain challenges and cost impacts, which we expect will continue at least through the first half of fiscal 2022 and potentially into the second half of fiscal 2022.', 'The magnitude and duration of the disruption, its continuing impact on us, and resulting decline in global business activity is uncertain.', 'These disruptions include the unprecedented actions taken to try to contain the pandemic such as travel bans and restrictions, business closures, and social distancing measures, such as quarantines and shelter-in-place orders.', 'The COVID-19 pandemic and the responsive measures taken in many countries have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.', 'Shelter-in-place orders and other measures, including work-from-home and other policies implemented to protect workers, has and could in the future impact our supply chain.', 'Such disruptions may continue, or worsen, in the future.', 'In addition, current and future restrictions or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transport, port closures, and increased border controls or closures, can also impact our ability to meet customer demand and could materially adversely affect us.', 'Our customers have also experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions in their operations, which can result in delayed, reduced, or canceled orders, and increased collection risks, and which may adversely affect our results of operations.', 'The COVID-19 pandemic may also result in long-term changes in customer needs for our products and services in various sectors, along with IT-related capital spending reductions, or shifts in spending focus, that could materially adversely affect us if we are unable to adjust our product and service offerings to match customer needs.', 'The recent shift to a remote working environment also creates challenges.', 'For example, governmental lockdowns, restrictions or new regulations has and could in the future impact the ability of our employees and vendors to work with the same speed and productivity in certain areas, even as other areas do not see negative impact.', 'The extent and/or duration of ongoing workforce 13Table of Contentsrestrictions and limitations could impact our ability to enhance, develop and support existing products and services, and hold product sales and marketing events to the extent we were able to previously.', 'In addition, malefactors are seeking to use the COVID-19 pandemic to launch new cyber-attacks.', 'The COVID-19 pandemic has also led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets.', 'The pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future.', 'The inputs into certain of our judgments, assumptions, and estimates considered the economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on our critical and significant accounting estimates.', 'The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates.', 'As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop, many of our estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility.', 'As events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods.', 'We are continuing to monitor the pandemic and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities.', 'The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside our control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy.', 'Potential negative impacts of these external factors include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects on demand for our products and services; our supply chain and sales and distribution channels; collectability of customer accounts; our ability to execute strategic plans; impairments; and our profitability and cost structure.', 'To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations and financial condition, it may also have the effect of exacerbating the other risks discussed in this “Risk Factors” section.', 'Our operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which may adversely affect our stock price.', 'Our operating results have been in the past, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors, some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment.', 'These factors include:•Fluctuations in demand for our products and services, especially with respect to service providers and Internet businesses, in part due to changes in the global economic environment•Changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our customers’ spending plans and associated revenue•Our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels and purchase commitments•Price and product competition in the communications and networking industries, which can change rapidly due to technological innovation and different business models from various geographic regions•The overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitors and our customers•The introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products, and our success in new and evolving markets, and in emerging technologies, as well as the adoption of new standards•The transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offerings where revenue is recognized over time•Variations in sales channels, product costs, mix of products sold, or mix of direct sales and indirect sales•The timing, size, and mix of orders from customers•Manufacturing and customer lead times•Fluctuations in our gross margins, and the factors that contribute to such fluctuations•The ability of our customers, channel partners, contract manufacturers and suppliers to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures, especially during a period of global credit market disruption or in the event of customer, channel partner, contract manufacturer or supplier financial problems•Actual events, circumstances, outcomes, and amounts differing from judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in determining the values of certain assets (including the amounts of related valuation allowances), liabilities, and other items reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements•How well we execute on our strategy and operating plans and the impact of changes in our business model that could result in significant restructuring charges•Our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions•Benefits anticipated from our investments•Changes in tax laws or accounting rules, or interpretations thereof14Table of Contents As a consequence, operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict, and, therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods.', 'Any of the foregoing factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price.', 'Our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment.', 'Challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries at large, as well as in specific segments and markets in which we operate, resulting in: reduced demand for our products as a result of continued constraints on IT-related capital spending by our customers, particularly service providers, and other customer markets as well; increased price competition for our products, not only from our competitors but also as a consequence of customers disposing of unutilized products; risk of excess and obsolete inventories; risk of supply constraints; risk of excess facilities and manufacturing capacity; and higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue and higher interest expense.', 'The global macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging and inconsistent, and is being significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'During fiscal 2020 and the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we continued to see a broad-based weakening in the global macroeconomic environment which impacted our commercial and enterprise markets.', 'We also experienced continuing weakness in emerging countries, and we expect ongoing uncertainty in this market.', 'Additionally, instability in the global credit markets, the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy, the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world including as a result of the United Kingdom “Brexit” withdrawal from the European Union, the current economic challenges in China, including global economic ramifications of Chinese economic difficulties, and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions.', 'If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets, remain uncertain or deteriorate further, we may experience material impacts on our business, operating results, and financial condition.', 'Our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment.', 'In addition, reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the U. S. government could affect customers’ perception of the products of IT companies which design and manufacture products in the United States.', 'Trust and confidence in us as an IT supplier are critical to the development and growth of our markets.', 'Impairment of that trust, or foreign regulatory actions taken in response to reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the U. S. government, could affect the demand for our products from customers outside of the United States and could have an adverse effect on our operating results.', 'Our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results.', 'As a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report, our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict, especially in light of a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment, the significant impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and related market uncertainty.', 'Our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or decline as it did in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, and in certain prior periods on a year-over-year basis.', 'Our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods.', 'We have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments, leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns.', 'In addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period, nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs, because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred, as well as in potential additional inventory management-related costs.', 'In addition, to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in periods in which our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter.', 'The timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter.', 'From time to time, we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue.', 'The timing of such orders is difficult to predict, and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in revenue.', 'As a result, our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue.', 'Longer than normal manufacturing lead times in the past have caused, and in the future could cause, some customers to place the same or a similar order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon shipment or receipt of the product, or to also place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times.', 'Such multiple ordering (along with other factors) or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue.', 'Further, our efforts to improve manufacturing lead-time performance may result in more variability and less predictability in our revenue and operating results.', 'In addition, when facing 15Table of Contentscomponent supply-related challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations, which in turn contribute to an increase in inventory and purchase commitments.', 'For example, in fiscal 2021, we increased our inventory and purchase commitments in light of the supply chain challenges seen industrywide due to component shortages, caused in part by the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'These increases in our inventory and purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to significant excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations.', 'We plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels.', 'These expenses and the impact of long-term commitments are relatively fixed in the short term.', 'A shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to short-term business changes.', 'Any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results.', 'Supply chain issues, including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers, or a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increase our costs or cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders, could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results, and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply, which could adversely affect our gross margins.', 'The fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facilities and that we are reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results.', 'Financial problems of either contract manufacturers or component suppliers, reservation of manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturers by other companies, and industry consolidation occurring within one or more component supplier markets, such as the semiconductor market, in each case, could either limit supply or increase costs.', 'A reduction or interruption in supply, including disruptions on our global supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or a significant natural disaster (including as a result of climate change); a significant increase in the price of one or more components; a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers; a failure to appropriately cancel, reschedule, or adjust our requirements based on our business needs; or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships.', 'Furthermore, as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers, we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market.', 'In the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used, our gross margins could decrease.', 'In addition, vendors may be under pressure to allocate product to certain customers for business, regulatory or political reasons, and/or demand changes in agreed pricing as a condition of supply.', 'Although we have generally secured additional supply or taken other mitigation actions when significant disruptions have occurred, if similar situations occur in the future, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.', 'Our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers.', 'We have experienced component shortages in the past, including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues, that have affected our operations, including longer than normal lead times.', 'There is currently a market shortage of semiconductor and other component supply which has affected, and could further affect, lead times, the cost of that supply, and our ability to meet customer demand for our products if we cannot secure sufficient supply in a timely manner.', 'We expect these supply chain challenges and cost impacts to continue through at least the first half of fiscal 2022 and potentially into the second half of fiscal 2022.', 'Additionally, we may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues, manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers, capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers including capacity or cost problems resulting from industry consolidation, or strong demand for those parts.', 'Growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels and manufacturing capacity, especially for labor-intensive components, components for which we purchase a substantial portion of the supply, or the re-ramping of manufacturing capacity for highly complex products.', 'During periods of shortages or delays the price of components may increase, or the components may not be available at all, and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs.', 'We may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed.', 'Accordingly, our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed.', 'Our operating results would also be adversely affected if, anticipating greater demand than actually develops, we commit to the purchase of more components than we need, which is more likely to occur in a period of demand uncertainties such as we are currently experiencing.', 'There can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future.', 'Although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products, certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources, and a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively impact the availability of components from one or more of these sources, especially during times such as we have recently seen when there are supplier constraints based on labor and other actions taken during economic downturns.', 'We may not be able to diversify 16Table of Contentssources in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales.', 'We believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future: new markets in which we participate may grow quickly, which may make it difficult to quickly obtain significant component capacity; as we acquire companies and new technologies, we may be dependent on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners; and we face competition for certain components that are supply-constrained, from existing competitors, and companies in other markets.', 'Manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for us.', 'We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products.', 'During the normal course of business, in order to improve manufacturing lead-time performance and to help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements.', 'In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed.', 'When facing component supply-related challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations, which in turn contributes to an increase in inventory and purchase commitments.', 'For example, in fiscal 2021, we increased our inventory and purchase commitments in light of the supply chain challenges seen industrywide due to component shortages, caused in part by the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'These increases in our inventory and purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to significant excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations.', 'If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins.', 'For additional information regarding our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.', 'We expect gross margin to vary over time, and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable.', 'Our level of product gross margins declined in fiscal 2021 and have declined in certain prior periods on a year-over-year basis, and could decline in future periods due to adverse impacts from various factors, including:•Changes in customer, geographic, or product mix, including mix of configurations within each product group•Introduction of new products, including products with price-performance advantages, and new business models including the transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offerings•Our ability to reduce production costs•Entry into new markets or growth in lower margin markets, including markets with different pricing and cost structures, through acquisitions or internal development•Sales discounts•Increases in material, labor or other manufacturing-related costs (i. e. component costs, broker fees, expedited freight and overtime) or higher supply chain logistics costs, any of which could be significant, especially during periods of supply constraints for certain costs, such as those impacting the market for components, including semiconductors and memory•Excess inventory, inventory holding charges, and obsolescence charges•Changes in shipment volume•The timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals•Increased cost (including those caused by tariffs), loss of cost savings or dilution of savings due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if parts ordering does not correctly anticipate product demand or if the financial health of either contract manufacturers or suppliers deteriorates•Lower than expected benefits from value engineering•Increased price competition, including competitors from Asia, especially from China•Changes in distribution channels•Increased warranty or royalty costs•Increased amortization of purchased intangible assets, especially from acquisitions•How well we execute on our strategy and operating plans Changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services, as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods.', '17Table of Contents Sales to the service provider market are especially volatile, and weakness in orders from this industry may harm our operating results and financial condition.', 'Sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases, especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain other Infrastructure Platforms and Applications products, in addition to longer sales cycles.', 'Service provider product orders decreased during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and in certain prior periods, and at various times in the past, including in recent quarters, we have experienced significant weakness in product orders from service providers.', 'Product orders from the service provider market could continue to decline and, as has been the case in the past, such weakness could persist over extended periods of time given fluctuating market conditions.', 'Sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures; the availability of funding; and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory, economic, and business conditions in the country of operations.', 'Weakness in orders from this industry, including as a result of any slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers (which may be more prevalent during a global economic downturn, or periods of economic, political or regulatory uncertainty), could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.', 'Such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods.', 'Orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets.', 'For example, in the past, many of our service provider customers have been materially and adversely affected by slowdowns in the general economy, by overcapacity, by changes in the service provider market, by regulatory developments, and by constraints on capital availability, resulting in business failures and substantial reductions in spending and expansion plans.', 'These conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past, and could affect our business and operating results in any future period.', 'Finally, service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles; require a broader range of services, including design services; demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks; often require acceptance provisions, which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition; and expect financing from vendors.', 'All these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers.', 'Disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins.', 'If we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly, or if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken, our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected.', 'A substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners, and the remainder is sold through direct sales.', 'Our channel partners include systems integrators, service providers, other resellers, and distributors.', 'Systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation, technical support, professional services, and other support services in addition to network equipment sales.', 'Systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution, and a number of service providers are also systems integrators.', 'Distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators, service providers, and other resellers.', 'We refer to sales through distributors as our two-tier system of sales to the end customer.', 'If sales through indirect channels increase, this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and, to a degree, the timing of orders from our customers.', 'Historically, we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels.', 'There can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability.', 'Some factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model, which could harm our sales and margins, including the following: competition with some of our channel partners, including through our direct sales, which may lead these channel partners to use other suppliers that do not directly sell their own products or otherwise compete with them; some of our channel partners may demand that we absorb a greater share of the risks that their customers may ask them to bear; some of our channel partners may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes and challenges in business conditions; and revenue from indirect sales could suffer if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken.', 'In addition, we depend on our channel partners globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirements.', 'To the extent that they fail to do so, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.', 'Further, sales of our products outside of agreed territories can result in disruption to our distribution channels.', 'The markets in which we compete are intensely competitive, which could adversely affect our achievement of revenue growth.', 'The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies, and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages.', 'These market factors represent a competitive threat to us.', 'We compete with numerous vendors in each product category.', 'The overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase.', 'Also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product areas, and in key priority and growth areas.', 'For example, as products related to network programmability, such as software defined networking (SDN) products, become more prevalent, we expect to face increased competition from companies that develop networking products based on commoditized hardware, referred to as “white box” hardware, to the extent customers decide to purchase those product offerings instead of ours.', 'In addition, the growth in demand for technology 18Table of Contentsdelivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market.', 'As we continue to expand globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions.', 'In particular, we have experienced price-focused competition from competitors in Asia, especially from China, and we anticipate this will continue.', 'For information regarding our competitors, see the section entitled “Competition” contained in Item 1.  Business of this report.', 'Some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product area.', 'Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed.', 'In addition, some of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do.', 'As we expand into new markets, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and sales positions in those markets.', 'We also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products.', 'Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and this trend may increase.', 'For example, the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies, including computing, networking, storage, and software, that previously were segregated.', 'Due to several factors, including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors, ASICs offering advanced services, standards based protocols, cloud computing and virtualization, the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple, previously independent, technology segments.', 'Also, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them to provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data center.', 'As a result of all of these developments, we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies, including competition from entities that are among our long-term strategic alliance partners.', 'Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us.', 'The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include the ability to sell successful business outcomes; the ability to provide a broad range of networking and communications products and services; product performance; price; the ability to introduce new products, including providing continuous new customer value and products with price-performance advantages; the ability to reduce production costs; the ability to provide value-added features such as security, reliability, and investment protection; conformance to standards; market presence; the ability to provide financing; and disruptive technology shifts and new business models.', 'We also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology.', 'The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability.', 'As such, we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies.', 'Any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success.', 'If we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances, we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances, and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development.', 'We have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with which we work to offer complementary products and services and, in the past, have established a joint venture to market services associated with our Cisco Unified Computing System products.', 'These arrangements are generally limited to specific projects, the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards.', 'There can be no assurance we will realize the expected benefits from these strategic alliances or from the joint venture.', 'If successful, these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth.', 'However, alliances carry an element of risk because, in most cases, we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and, at the same time, cooperate with that company in other business areas.', 'Also, if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected, we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties.', 'Joint ventures can be difficult to manage, given the potentially different interests of joint venture partners.', 'Inventory management relating to our sales to our two-tier distribution channel is complex, and excess inventory may harm our gross margins.', 'We must manage inventory relating to sales to our distributors effectively, because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations.', 'Our distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high, or delay orders in anticipation of new products.', 'They also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them, and in response to seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand.', 'Our distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling price, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs.', 'Inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements.', 'When facing component supply-related 19Table of Contentschallenges, we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations.', 'If we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory, which in turn could result in lower gross margins.', 'We depend upon the development of new products and services, and enhancements to existing products and services, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs, our operating results and market share may suffer.', 'The markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, new product and service introductions, and evolving methods of building and operating networks.', 'Our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products and services into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products.', 'If customers do not purchase and/or renew our offerings our business could be harmed.', 'The COVID-19 pandemic may also result in long-term changes in customer needs for our products and services in various sectors, along with IT-related capital spending reductions, or shifts in spending focus, that could materially adversely affect us if we are unable to adjust our product and service offerings to match customer needs.', 'The process of developing new technology, including more programmable, flexible and virtual networks, and technology related to other market transitions— such as security, digital transformation and Io T, and cloud— is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed.', 'We must commit significant resources, including the investments we have been making in our strategic priorities to developing new products and services before knowing whether our investments will result in products and services the market will accept.', 'In particular, if our model of the evolution of networking does not emerge as we believe it will, or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will, or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful, many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value.', 'For example, if we do not introduce products related to network programmability, such as software-defined-networking products, in a timely fashion, or if product offerings in this market that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, that differs from ours, such as, for example, networking products based on “white box” hardware, our business could be harmed.', 'Similarly, our business could be harmed if we fail to develop, or fail to develop in a timely fashion, offerings to address other transitions, or if the offerings addressing these other transitions that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, different from ours.', 'In addition, our business could be adversely affected in periods surrounding our new product introductions if customers delay purchasing decisions to qualify or otherwise evaluate the new product offerings.', 'We have also been transforming our business to move from selling individual products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions, and we are seeking to meet the evolving needs of customers which include offering our products and solutions in the manner in which customers wish to consume them.', 'As a part of this transformation, we continue to make changes to how we are organized and how we build and deliver our technology, including changes in our business models with customers.', 'If our strategy for addressing our customer needs, or the architectures and solutions we develop do not meet those needs, or the changes we are making in how we are organized and how we build and deliver or technology is incorrect or ineffective, our business could be harmed.', 'Furthermore, we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing, technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion, or a lack of appropriate resources.', 'This could result in competitors, some of which may also be our strategic alliance partners, providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share, revenue, and earnings.', 'In addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market.', 'The success of new products and services depends on several factors, including proper new product and service definition, component costs, timely completion and introduction of these products and services, differentiation of new products and services from those of our competitors, and market acceptance of these products and services.', 'There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product and services opportunities, develop and bring new products and services to market in a timely manner, or achieve market acceptance of our products and services or that products, services and technologies developed by others will not render our products, services or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.', 'The products and technologies in our other product categories and key priority and growth areas may not prove to have the market success we anticipate, and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new products and services.', 'Changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses, asset impairments and workforce reductions or restructurings.', 'In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign our resources and to consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses.', 'Any resource realignment, or decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses, may result in the recording of special charges, such as inventory and technology-related write-offs, workforce reduction or restructuring costs, charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities, or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products.', 'Our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets, including purchased intangible assets, could change as a result of such 20Table of Contentsassessments and decisions.', 'Although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed, our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel with contract manufacturers and suppliers.', 'Further, our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions.', 'Additionally, we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings.', 'We initiated a restructuring plan in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, which included a voluntary early retirement program, and which has now been substantially completed.', 'Our business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation of the plan.', 'Our restructuring activities, including any related charges and the impact of the related headcount restructurings, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.', 'Over the long term we intend to invest in engineering, sales, service and marketing activities, and in key priority and growth areas, and these investments may achieve delayed, or lower than expected, benefits which could harm our operating results.', 'While we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses, over the long term, we also intend to invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering, sales, service and marketing functions as we realign and dedicate resources on key priority and growth areas, such as Security and Applications, and we also intend to focus on maintaining leadership in Infrastructure Platforms and in Services.', 'We are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect.', 'If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments (including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect), or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected.', 'We have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.', 'Our growth depends upon market growth, our ability to enhance our existing products, and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis.', 'We intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies, product lines, technologies, and personnel.', 'Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:•Difficulties in integrating the operations, systems, technologies, products, and personnel of the acquired companies, particularly companies with large and widespread operations and/or complex products•Diversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread operations resulting from acquisitions•Potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in-process research and development intangibles•Difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions•Initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners•Insufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions•The potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the companies we acquire following and continuing after announcement of acquisition plans Acquisitions may also cause us to:•Issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership•Use a substantial portion of our cash resources, or incur debt•Significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition•Assume liabilities•Record goodwill and intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges•Incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets•Incur tax expenses related to the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure•Incur large write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses•Become subject to intellectual property or other litigation21Table of Contents Mergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control, and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition.', 'Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results.', 'Prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes, from successful introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so.', 'Even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products.', 'In addition, our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions.', 'Risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions.', 'Entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations.', 'As we focus on new market opportunities and key priority and growth areas, we will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies.', 'Several of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do.', 'Additionally, as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments, they may require greater levels of service, support, and financing than we have provided in the past, especially in emerging countries.', 'Demand for these types of service, support, or financing contracts may increase in the future.', 'There can be no assurance that we can provide products, service, support, and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities.', 'Further, entry into other markets has subjected and will subject us to additional risks, particularly to those markets, including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence.', 'For example, as we add direct selling capabilities globally to meet changing customer demands, we will face increased legal and regulatory requirements.', 'Industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results.', 'There is a continuing trend toward industry consolidation in our markets.', 'We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations.', 'For example, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them with the ability to provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data center.', 'Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us.', 'We believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers.', 'This could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.', 'Furthermore, particularly in the service provider market, rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers, with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants.', 'Product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue, gross margins, and net income.', 'We produce highly complex products that incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software.', 'Software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations.', 'There can be no assurance that our pre-shipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects, either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments, which might interfere with customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities, or affect gross margins.', 'From time to time, we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped.', 'There can be no assurance that such remediation, depending on the product involved, would not have a material impact.', 'An inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, damage to our reputation, inventory costs, or product reengineering expenses, any of which could have a material impact on our revenue, margins, and net income.', 'Due to the global nature of our operations, political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition.', 'We conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries around the world.', 'As such, our growth depends in part on our increasing sales into emerging countries.', 'We also depend on non-U.', 'S. operations of our contract manufacturers, component suppliers and distribution partners.', 'Our business in emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in orders in the first half of fiscal 2021 and in certain prior periods.', 'We continue to assess the sustainability of any improvements in our business in these countries and there can be no assurance that our investments in these countries will be successful.', 'Our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of political, economic or other factors relating to our operations inside and outside the United States, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, including the following: impacts from global central bank monetary policy; issues related to the political relationship between the United States and other countries that can affect regulatory matters, affect the willingness of customers in those countries to purchase products from companies headquartered in the United States or affect our ability to 22Table of Contentsprocure components if a government body were to deny us access to those components; government-related disruptions or shutdowns; the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment; foreign currency exchange rates; political or social unrest; economic instability or weakness or natural disasters in a specific country or region, including economic challenges in China and global economic ramifications of Chinese economic difficulties; instability as a result of Brexit; environmental protection regulations (including new laws and regulations related to climate change), trade protection measures such as tariffs, and other legal and regulatory requirements, some of which may affect our ability to import our products to, export our products from, or sell our products in various countries or affect our ability to procure components; political considerations that affect service provider and government spending patterns; health or similar issues, including pandemics or epidemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic which could continue to affect customer purchasing decisions; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and adverse tax consequences, including imposition of withholding or other taxes on our global operations.', 'We are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets, which could result in material losses.', 'Most of our sales are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of 30 days in the United States and, because of local customs or conditions, longer in some markets outside the United States.', 'Beyond our open credit arrangements, we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements.', 'Our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services.', 'Our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities may increase if our customers are adversely affected by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty.', 'There can be no assurance that programs we have in place to monitor and mitigate credit risks will be effective.', 'In the past, there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements, particularly among Internet businesses and service providers, causing us to incur economic or financial losses.', 'There can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred.', 'Although these losses have not been material to date, future losses, if incurred, could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.', 'Additionally, to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing, those customers’ ability to pay could be adversely impacted, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.', 'We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates; impairment of our investments could harm our earnings.', 'We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities.', 'Our portfolio includes available-for-sale debt investments and equity investments, the values of which are subject to market price volatility.', 'If such investments suffer market price declines, as we experienced with some of our investments in the past, we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis.', 'Our privately held investments are subject to risk of loss of investment capital.', 'These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize.', 'We could lose our entire investment in these companies.', 'For information regarding the market risks associated with the fair value of portfolio investments and interest rates, refer to the section titled “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.', '”We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.', 'Because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, including emerging market currencies which can have extreme currency volatility.', 'An increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the United States where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies.', 'These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows.', 'Failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives.', 'Our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, sales, and marketing personnel.', 'Competition for these personnel is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California.', 'Stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us.', 'Volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity incentive awards, or changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, resulting from the management of share dilution and share-based compensation expense or otherwise, may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees.', 'As a result of one or more of these factors, we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the United States, which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk.', 'The loss of services of any of our key personnel; the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future; or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly engineering and sales personnel, 23Table of Contentscould make it difficult to meet key objectives, such as timely and effective product introductions.', 'In addition, companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices.', 'We have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future.', 'Adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm our operating results or financial condition.', 'We are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business.', 'Litigation can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations.', 'Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict.', 'An unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.', 'For additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, subsection (f) “Legal Proceedings.', '”Our operating results may be adversely affected and damage to our reputation may occur due to production and sale of counterfeit versions of our products.', 'As is the case with leading products around the world, our products are subject to efforts by third parties to produce counterfeit versions of our products.', 'While we work diligently with law enforcement authorities in various countries to block the manufacture of counterfeit goods and to interdict their sale, and to detect counterfeit products in customer networks, and have succeeded in prosecuting counterfeiters and their distributors, resulting in fines, imprisonment and restitution to us, there can be no guarantee that such efforts will succeed.', 'While counterfeiters often aim their sales at customers who might not have otherwise purchased our products due to lack of verifiability of origin and service, such counterfeit sales, to the extent they replace otherwise legitimate sales, could adversely affect our operating results.', 'Changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results.', 'Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to foreign-derived intangible income, global intangible low-tax income and base erosion and anti-abuse tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules.', 'Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes.', 'The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 38 countries, including the United States, has made changes and is contemplating additional changes to numerous long-standing tax principles.', 'There can be no assurance that these changes and any contemplated changes if finalized, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes.', 'Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates.', 'Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes.', 'In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities.', 'We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.', 'There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.', 'Our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes, floods, and other natural catastrophic events (including as a result of global climate change).', 'Our corporate headquarters, including certain of our research and development operations are located in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California, a region known for seismic activity.', 'Additionally, a certain number of our facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past.', 'Also certain of our suppliers and logistics centers are located in regions that have been or may be affected by earthquake, tsunami and flooding activity which in the past has disrupted, and in the future could disrupt, the flow of components and delivery of products.', 'In addition, global climate change may result in significant natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, and flooding.', 'A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, a hurricane, volcano, flood or a wildfire, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.', 'Terrorism and other events may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.', 'The continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause further disruptions to the economies of the United States and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.', 'Likewise, events such as loss 24Table of Contentsof infrastructure and utilities services such as energy, transportation, or telecommunications could have similar negative impacts.', 'To the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.', 'There can be no assurance that our operating results and financial condition will not be adversely affected by our incurrence of debt.', 'As of the end of fiscal 2021, we have senior unsecured notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of $11.', '5 billion that mature at specific dates from calendar year 2021 through 2040.', 'We have also established a commercial paper program under which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $10.', '0 billion, and we had no commercial paper notes outstanding under this program as of July\\xa031, 2021.', 'There can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt or any future debt will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources.', 'Further, we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.', 'In addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the terms upon which we may borrow under our commercial paper program or future debt issuances.', 'Risks Related to Intellectual Property Our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce.', 'We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products.', 'Although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending, there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or that our rights will, in fact, provide competitive advantages to us.', 'Furthermore, many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards, which are usable by all market entrants.', 'In addition, there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology.', 'In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.', 'The outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the United States.', 'Although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete, if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features (including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights) in a market, we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense, time, and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful.', 'We may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others.', 'Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us.', 'These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States.', 'Because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field, the secrecy of some pending patents, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others.', 'The asserted claims and/or initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers, or customers, alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products.', 'Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, or require us to develop a non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements.', 'Where claims are made by customers, resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships.', 'There can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all, or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers.', 'Furthermore, because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable, it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts.', 'If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim against the customer, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.', 'For additional information regarding our indemnification obligations, see Note 14(e) to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report.', 'Our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions, as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks.', 'Further, in the 25Table of Contentspast, third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition.', 'We rely on the availability of third-party licenses.', 'Many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties.', 'It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products.', 'There can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all.', 'The inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.', 'Moreover, the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products.', 'Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Regulations Cyber-attacks, data breaches or malware may disrupt our operations, harm our operating results and financial condition, and damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business; and cyber-attacks or data breaches on our customers’ networks, or in cloud-based services provided by or enabled by us, could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.', 'We experience cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis, and we anticipate continuing to be subject to such attempts.', 'Despite our implementation of security measures, (i) our products and services, and (ii) the servers, data centers, and cloud-based solutions on which our and third-party data is stored, are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, data breaches, malware, and disruptions from unauthorized access, tampering or other theft or misuse, including by employees, malicious actors or inadvertent error.', 'Such events have and could in the future compromise or disrupt access to or the operation of our products, services, and networks or those of our customers, or result in the information stored on our systems or those of our customers being improperly accessed, processed, disclosed, lost or stolen.', 'We have not to date experienced a material event; however, the occurrence of any such event in the future could subject us to liability to our customers, suppliers, business partners and others, give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, could damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.', 'Efforts to limit the ability of malicious actors to disrupt the operations of the Internet or undermine our own security efforts may be costly to implement and may not be successful.', 'Breaches of security in our customers’ networks, or in cloud-based services provided by or enabled by us, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services, could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.', 'Vulnerabilities and critical security defects, prioritization decisions regarding remedying vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-party providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects, or customers not deploying security releases or deciding not to upgrade products, services or solutions could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation, or otherwise materially harm our business.', 'The products and services we sell to customers, and our cloud-based solutions, inevitably contain vulnerabilities or critical security defects which have not been remedied and cannot be disclosed without compromising security.', 'We also make prioritization decisions in determining which vulnerabilities or security defects to fix and the timing of these fixes.', 'Customers may also need to test security releases before they can be deployed which can delay implementation.', 'In addition, we rely on third-party providers of software and cloud-based services, and we cannot control the rate at which they remedy vulnerabilities.', 'When customers do not deploy specific releases, or decide not to upgrade to the latest versions of our products, services or cloud-based solutions containing the release, they may be left vulnerable.', 'Vulnerabilities and critical security defects, prioritization errors in remedying vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-party providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects, or customers not deploying specific releases or deciding not to upgrade products, services or solutions could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.', 'Our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed by regulatory uncertainty applicable to our products and services.', 'Changes in regulatory requirements applicable to the industries in which we operate, in the United States and in other countries, could materially affect the sales of our products and services.', 'In particular, changes in telecommunications regulations could impact our service provider customers’ purchase of our products and offers, and they could also impact sales of our own regulated offers.', 'In addition, evolving legal requirements restricting or controlling the collection, processing, or cross-border transmission of data, including regulation of cloud-based services, could materially affect our customers’ ability to use, and our ability to sell, our products and offers.', 'Additional areas of uncertainty that could impact sales of our products and offers include laws and regulations related to encryption technology, environmental sustainability (including climate change), export control, 26Table of Contentsproduct certification, and national security controls applicable to our supply chain.', 'For example, new laws and regulations in response to climate change could result in increased energy efficiency for our products and increased compliance and energy costs.', 'Changes in regulatory requirements in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.', 'Risks Related to Ownership of Our Stock Our stock price may be volatile.', 'Historically, our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility, particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us.', 'Furthermore, speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, results of operations, business, security of our products, or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price.', 'In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies, in particular, and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies.', 'These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions, or any difficulties associated with such transactions, by us or our current or potential competitors, may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future.', 'Additionally, volatility, lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, virtually all of whom are compensated, in part, based on the performance of our stock price.']\n",

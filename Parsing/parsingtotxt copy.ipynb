Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item\\xa08, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.', 'The business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company’s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results.', 'Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price.', 'Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.', 'Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth\\n.', 'The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales.', 'In addition, a majority of the Company’s supply chain, and its manufacturing and assembly activities, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.', 'Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations could materially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services.', 'In addition, consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors.', '\\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions could have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.', 'Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company’s products; and insolvency.', 'A downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments.', 'These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth.', 'Global markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.', 'The Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.', 'The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace.', 'The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services.', 'As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D.', 'There can be no assurance that these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.', 'The Company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, numerous patents, trademarks and service marks.', 'In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and emulating\\xa0the Company’s\\xa0products and infringing on\\xa0its\\xa0intellectual property.', 'If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected.', 'Apple Inc.', '| 2018 Form 10-K | \\n8\\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, tablet and personal computer markets.', 'The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships.', 'In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices.', 'Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins.', 'Certain competitors may have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss.', 'Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors attempt to imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.', 'The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.', 'Some of the markets in which the Company competes, including the market for personal computers, have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted.', 'In addition, an increasing number of internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller, simpler and cheaper than traditional personal computers compete with some of the Company’s existing products.', 'The Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases.', 'The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free.', 'The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.', 'The Company’s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve its products and services in order to maintain their functional and design advantages.', 'There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.', 'To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.', 'Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services.', 'The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies.', 'Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service introductions and transitions.', 'The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.', 'The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers.', 'The Company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid-sized businesses through its retail and online stores.', 'Some carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device.', 'There is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company’s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers.', 'The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays.', 'These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue.', 'The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products.', 'Apple Inc.', '| 2018 Form 10-K | \\n9\\nThe Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.', 'The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value.', 'The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components.', 'The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable.', 'If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value.', 'Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.', 'The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments.', 'Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to \\n150 days\\n.', 'Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.', 'Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.', 'Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks.', 'Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.', 'While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.', 'Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms.', 'The effects of global or regional economic conditions on\\xa0the Company’s suppliers, described in \\n“\\nGlobal and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth\\n”\\n above, also could affect the Company’s ability to obtain components\\n.', '\\nTherefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.', 'The Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source.', 'When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased.', 'Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.', 'If the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.', 'The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.', 'The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\\nSubstantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia.', 'A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations.', 'The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management.', 'While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution.', 'Such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions.', 'Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability.', 'While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur.', 'The Company relies on single-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products.', 'Any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods.', 'In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.', 'Apple Inc.', '| 2018 Form 10-K | \\n10\\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements.', 'While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments could be negatively impacted.', 'The Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.', 'The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects.', 'Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products.', 'Defects may also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties.', 'Component defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury.', 'These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including healthcare.', 'In addition, the Company’s service offerings may have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors.', 'As a result, the Company’s services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations.', 'There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers.', 'Failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services.', 'In addition, the Company may be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines.', 'Quality problems could also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and services introductions and lost revenue.', 'The Company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.', 'The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers.', 'This includes the right to sell currently available music, movies, TV shows and books.', 'The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all.', 'Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future.', 'Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content.', 'The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach.', 'Failure to obtain the right to make third-party digital content available, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.', 'Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions.', 'If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions.', 'There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.', 'In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Company’s content providers.', 'The Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.', 'The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services.', 'There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products.', 'If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company’s products.', 'The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets and Windows for personal computers.', 'This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales and the costs of developing such applications and services.', 'Apple Inc.', '| 2018 Form 10-K | \\n11\\nThe Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, tablet and personal computer markets could make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share.', 'If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices may suffer.', 'The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products.', 'The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly and may result in dissatisfied customers.', 'The Company sells and delivers third-party applications for its products through the App Store, Mac App Store and TV App Store.', 'The Company retains a commission from sales through these platforms.', 'If developers reduce their use of these platforms to distribute their applications and offer in-app purchases to customers, then the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease.', 'The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.', 'Many of the Company’s products include third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third parties.', 'Based on past experience and industry practice, the Company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms.', 'There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all.', 'Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.', 'The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights\\n.', 'The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new claims may arise in the future.', 'In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party.', 'Claims against the Company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase.', 'In particular, the Company has historically faced a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future.', 'For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.', 'The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of U.S. jurisdictions and before the U.S. International Trade Commission, as well as internationally in various countries.', 'The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.', 'Regardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to management.', 'In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes.', 'No assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur.', 'These agreements may also significantly increase the Company’s operating expenses.', 'Except as described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 9, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights.', 'The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.', 'If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.', 'Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.', 'While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.', 'Apple Inc.', '| 2018 Form 10-K | \\n12\\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the Company’s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Company’s business.', 'The Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas.', 'These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect the Company’s activities in areas including, but not limited to, labor, advertising, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy and data localization requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety.', 'By way of example, laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates are extensive and subject to change.', 'Such changes could include, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture, distribution and use of devices, locking devices to a carrier’s network, or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier’s network.', 'These devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks.', 'These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications, or delays in product shipment dates, or could preclude the Company from selling certain products.', 'Compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business.', 'Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make the Company’s products and services less attractive to the Company’s customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause the Company to change or limit its business practices.', 'The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no

import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy and data localization requirements, environmental laws, labor laws and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions.', 'Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the Company’s employees, contractors or agents could nevertheless occur.', 'In some cases, compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country.', 'Violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the Company’s brand, international growth efforts and business.', 'The Company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including, but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs, political instability and international trade disputes.', 'Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries, and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties.', 'The Company is also exposed to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets.', 'There can be no assurance the Company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.', 'The Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.', 'The Company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel.', 'The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space.', 'Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness.', 'Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company’s more typical retail stores.', 'Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company’s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs.', 'The Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company’s financial condition and operating results, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity.', 'Other factors include, but are not limited to, the Company’s ability to manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.', 'Apple Inc.', '| 2018 Form 10-K | \\n13\\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated.', 'The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions.', 'Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the Company’s due diligence.', 'These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful.', 'The Company’s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions.', 'The Company may be subject to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions.', 'System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities.', 'Such failures or disruptions could adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products.', 'These events could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.', 'There may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, that could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.', 'The Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information including, among other things, personally identifiable information (“PII”) with respect to the Company’s customers and employees.', 'The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data.', 'But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.', 'The Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties.', 'Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.', 'For example, the Company may experience a security breach impacting the Company’s information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information.', 'Such an incident could, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage supplier relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company.', 'Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including PII, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.', 'The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies.', 'As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities.', 'For example, third parties attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the Company’s information technology systems.', 'To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services.', 'In addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above, the Company may also be subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data.', 'Health data may be subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company may be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations.', 'If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare institutions, the Company could be subject to litigation or government investigations, may be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and could also incur significant fees or fines.', 'Apple Inc.', '| 2018

incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards.', 'The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which would materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.', 'While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.', 'The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.', 'The Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII.', 'In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also may restrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international subsidiaries.', 'Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions.', 'These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.', 'Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices.', 'Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.', 'The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of PII through its privacy policy, information provided on its website and press statements.', 'Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others.', 'In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.', 'The Company’s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel.', 'Much of the Company’s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees.', 'Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located.', 'The Company’s business may be impacted by political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.', 'Political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.', 'International trade disputes could result in tariffs and other protectionist measures that could adversely affect the Company’s business.', 'Tariffs could increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them.', 'These increased costs could adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products.', 'Tariffs could also make the Company’s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand.', 'Countries may also adopt other protectionist measures that could limit the Company’s ability to offer its products and services.', 'Political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and protectionist measures could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s business.', 'Many of the Company’s operations and facilities as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters.', 'In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company’s control.', 'Global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects.', 'Such events could make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings.', 'Following an interruption to its business, the Company could require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations, and lose significant revenue.', 'Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.', 'Apple Inc.', '| 2018 Form 10-K | \\n15\\nThe Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers.', 'While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company’s business and harm to the Company’s reputation.', 'Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers.', 'The Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate.', 'The Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels.', 'For example, gross margins on the Company’s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty and other cost fluctuations.', 'The Company’s financial results may be materially adversely impacted as a result of shifts in the mix of products and services that the Company sells; shifts in the geographic, currency or channel mix of the Company’s sales; component cost increases; price competition; or the introduction of new products, including new products with higher cost structures.', 'The Company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand.', 'Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses.', 'Further, the Company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales.', 'The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products, issues with new product introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.', 'The Company’s stock price is subject to volatility.', 'The Company’s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future.', 'Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance.', 'Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time.', 'The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability.', 'The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated.', 'Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares.', 'If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.', 'The Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.', 'The Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide.', 'Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.', 'Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products.', 'In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.', 'Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit.', 'Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.', 'The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.', 'The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.', 'Apple Inc.', '| 2018 Form 10-K | \\n16\\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio.', 'The Company’s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors.', 'As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially.', 'Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant realized losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.', 'The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.', 'The Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers.', 'The Company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers.', 'A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance.', 'The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited.', 'The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company.', 'In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components.', 'As of \\nSeptember\\xa029, 2018\\n, a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia.', 'While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.', 'The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.', 'The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized.', 'Due to economic and

unspecified software upgrades to the device’s essential software and/or non-software services free of charge.', 'Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the non-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the Company’s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services based on the Company’s ESPs is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided.', 'The Company’s process for determining ESPs involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable.', 'Should future facts and circumstances change, the Company’s ESPs and the future rate of related amortization for unspecified software upgrades and non-software services related to future sales of these devices could change.', 'Factors subject to change include the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services offered, the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services and the estimated period unspecified software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided.', 'The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs.', 'For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met.', 'The Company’s policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses.', 'For the Company’s other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered.', 'The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company’s historical experience.', 'Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue.', 'Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive.', 'Management’s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs.', 'If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have an adverse impact on the Company’s operating results.', 'Apple Inc.', '| 2018 Form 10-K | \\n33\\nValuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities\\nThe Company’s investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value.', 'Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are generally recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.', 'Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact the Company’s net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized.', 'Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security’s cost basis.', 'The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made.', 'In making this determination, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis.', 'The Company’s assessment of whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security, which would have an adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.', 'Inventory Valuation, Valuation of Manufacturing-Related Assets and Estimation of Purchase Commitment Cancellation Fees\\nThe Company purchases components and builds inventory in advance of product shipments and invests in manufacturing-related assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities.', 'In addition, the Company makes prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory.', 'The Company performs a regular review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels and component cost trends.', 'If the Company determines inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value, it records a write-down of the inventories.', 'The Company also reviews its manufacturing-related capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.', 'If the Company determines that an asset is not recoverable, it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value.', 'Any write-downs and/or impairments the Company may be required to record would adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.', 'The Company accrues for estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled.', 'Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to \\n150 days\\n.', 'If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company’s products, a change in the Company’s product development plans, or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company’s products, the Company may be required to record accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its operating results.', 'Warranty Costs\\nThe Company accrues the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures outside of the Company’s typical experience.', 'The Company regularly reviews these estimates and adjusts the amounts as necessary.', 'If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.', 'Income Taxes\\nThe Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results.', 'The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.', 'Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that will be in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled.', 'The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.', 'The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.', 'The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.', 'Apple Inc.', '| 2018 Form 10-K | \\n34\\nManagement believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to recover the Company’s deferred tax assets.', 'In the event that the Company determines all or part of its net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance and a corresponding charge to earnings in the period such determination is made.', 'In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws.', 'Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.', 'On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Act, which significantly changed U.S. tax law.', 'The Act lowered the Company’s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from \\n35%\\n to \\n21%\\n effective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income.', 'The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings.', 'The impact of the Act increased the Company’s provision for income taxes by \\n$1.5 billion\\n during 2018.', 'This increase was composed of \\n$2.0 billion\\n related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and liabilities and \\n$1.2 billion\\n associated with the deemed repatriation tax, partially offset by a \\n$1.7 billion\\n impact the deemed repatriation tax had on the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits.', 'Certain amounts reported by the Company related to the Act are provisional estimates in accordance with the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118.', 'Resolution of the Act’s effects different from the assumptions made by the Company could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 9, “Commitments and Contingencies,” the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.', 'The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment.', 'Except as described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 9, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.', 'The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.', 'If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.', '\\nItem ITEM7A:\\n>Item 7A.', 'Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\\nThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures.', 'Given the effective horizons of the Company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates.', 'Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.', 'Interest Rate Risk\\nThe Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment portfolio and outstanding debt.', 'While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, the Company’s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates.', 'Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company’s debt.', 'The Company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the Company’s liquidity requirements.', 'The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives.', 'The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.', 'The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.', 'To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve.', 'Based on investment positions as of \\nSeptember\\xa029, 2018\\n and \\nSeptember\\xa030, 2017\\n, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.9 billion and $6.0 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively.', 'Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.', 'Apple Inc.', '| 2018 Form 10-K | \\n35\\nAs of \\nSeptember\\xa029, 2018\\n and \\nSeptember\\xa030, 2017\\n, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of \\n$102.5 billion\\n and \\n$103.7 billion\\n, respectively.', 'The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt.', 'Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments.', 'Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument.', 'A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt as of \\nSeptember\\xa029, 2018\\n and \\nSeptember\\xa030, 2017\\n to increase by $399 million and $376 million on an annualized basis, respectively.', 'Further details regarding the Company’s debt is provided in Part II, Item\\xa08 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 5, “Debt.”\\nForeign Currency Risk\\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar.', 'Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars.', 'There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.', 'The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries.', 'In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency–denominated debt issuances.', 'The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.', 'However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.', 'To provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates.', 'The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions.', 'The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates.', 'The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool.', 'Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model.', 'Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $592 million as of \\nSeptember\\xa029, 2018\\n compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $485 million as of \\nSeptember\\xa030, 2017\\n.', 'Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.', 'Actual future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of \\nSeptember\\xa029, 2018\\n due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company’s actual exposures and positions.', 'Apple Inc.', '|

Company’s products and services include iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, AirPods, Apple TV, HomePod, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS operating systems, iCloud, Apple Pay and a variety of other accessory, service and support offerings.', 'The Company sells and delivers digital content and applications through the iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, TV App Store, Book Store and Apple Music (collectively “Digital Content and Services”).', 'The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers.', 'In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Apple-compatible products, including application software and various accessories, through its retail and online stores.', 'The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers.', 'Basis of Presentation and Preparation\\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company.', 'Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.', 'In the opinion of the Company’s management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation.', 'The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported.', 'Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.', 'Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.', 'The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September.', 'The Company’s fiscal years 2018 and 2016 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year 2017 included 53 weeks.', 'A 14th week was included in the first fiscal quarter of 2017, as is done every five or six years, to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters.', 'Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.', 'Revenue Recognition\\nNet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support contracts.', 'The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable.', 'Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred.', 'For most of the Company’s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped.', 'For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit.', 'For payment terms in excess of the Company’s standard payment terms, revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the Company has positive evidence that the sales price is fixed or determinable, such as a successful history of collection, without concession, on comparable arrangements.', 'The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance.', 'The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry-specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i)\\xa0standalone sales of software products, (ii)\\xa0sales of software upgrades and (iii)\\xa0sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.', 'For the sale of most third-party products, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers because the Company establishes its own pricing for such products, retains related inventory risk for physical products, is the primary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers.', 'For third-party applications sold through the App Store and Mac App Store and certain digital content sold through the iTunes Store, the Company does not determine the selling price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the customer.', 'Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from each sale.', 'The portion of the gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by the Company to third-party app developers and certain digital content owners is not reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.', 'Apple Inc.', '| 2018 Form 10-K | \\n43\\nThe Company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services.', 'This includes amounts that have been deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and

Store, App Store, Mac App Store, TV App Store and Book Store for the purchase of digital content and software.', 'The Company records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relieved upon redemption of the card by the customer.', 'Revenue from AppleCare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the service coverage periods.', 'AppleCare service and support contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the Company’s standard limited warranty.', 'The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs.', 'For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded.', 'For the Company’s other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered.', 'The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company’s historical experience.', 'Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.', 'Revenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables\\nFor multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product’s functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product’s essential software, and undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices.', 'In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i)\\xa0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), (ii)\\xa0third-party evidence of selling price (“TPE”) and (iii)\\xa0best estimate of selling price (“ESP”).', 'VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable.', 'ESPs reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.', 'For multi-element arrangements accounted for in accordance with industry-specific software accounting guidance, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on the VSOE of each element, and if VSOE does not exist revenue is recognized when elements lacking VSOE are delivered.', 'For sales of iPhone, iPad, Mac and certain other products, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the device’s essential software and/or non-software services free of charge.', 'The Company has identified up to \\nthree\\n deliverables regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of these devices.', 'The first deliverable, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale.', 'The second deliverable is the embedded right included with qualifying devices to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the product’s essential software.', 'The third deliverable is the non-software services to be provided to qualifying devices.', 'The Company allocates revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price method.', 'Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for these deliverables, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the time of sale, provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met.', 'Revenue allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade rights and the non-software services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided.', 'Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and related essential software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale.', 'Costs incurred to provide non-software services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred, and engineering and sales and marketing costs are recognized as operating expenses as incurred.', 'The Company’s process for determining its ESP for deliverables without VSOE or TPE considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company and market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives, estimated cost to provide the non-software services and the relative ESP of the upgrade rights and non-software services as compared to the total selling price of the product.', 'Shipping Costs\\nAmounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the Company’s shipping and handling costs are classified as cost of sales.', 'Advertising Costs\\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses.', 'Apple Inc.', '| 2018 Form 10-K | \\n44\\nShare-Based Compensation\\nThe Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest.', 'Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 8, “Benefit Plans.”\\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-09, \\nCompensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\\n (“ASU 2016-09”), which modified certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income taxes, classification of awards and\\xa0classification in the statement of cash flows.', 'Historically, excess tax benefits or deficiencies from the Company’s equity awards were recorded as additional paid-in capital in its Consolidated Balance Sheets and were classified as a financing activity in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.', 'Beginning in 2018, the Company records any excess tax benefits or deficiencies from its equity awards as part of the provision for income taxes in its Consolidated Statements of Operations in the reporting periods in which equity vesting occurs.', 'The Company elected to apply the cash flow classification requirements related to excess tax benefits

classified as cash equivalents.', 'The Company’s marketable debt and equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale.', 'The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date.', 'Marketable equity securities, including mutual funds, are classified as short-term based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations.', 'The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.', 'Inventories\\nInventories are computed using the first-in, first-out method.', 'Property, Plant and Equipment\\nDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of \\n30 years\\n or the remaining life of the underlying building; between \\none\\n and \\nfive years\\n for
